    - FINE AS-IS for video capture

    - GIF in Q 2 of 3 (Dinner party) should be smaller 
        - Can't do it in Inspector as it reloads 
        - Actually, it's fine in a smaller window

200226 - 

8:30 - 
    - GP-Chatbot 
        - conversational-forms GamePath had 110px of padding-top. Updated that to 10px.
        - i shouldn't need to rebuild. lessee if I can cp the html to the latest build dir ...  

7PM 

    - In the GP-IQ success screen, the conversational-form leads with a ton of space above the start of the content well. 
    - the GP-IQ build iframes this on the Success screen: https://gamepath.io/gamepath/GP.io-cforms/build/ -- update the c-f file and update the index.html symlink to point to the new version 


6:30 
    gulp from root created the build/ dir (self-contained)
    /home/smcnally/Documents/conversational-form/
    smcnally@FredTheBeast:~/Documents/conversational-form$ gulp 



5PM 

    Add privacy policy blurb to GP-IQ sponsorTagline 

		<cf-robot-message cf-questions="GamePath doesn't share your info."></cf-robot-message>

            <p style="float: left; color: #33475bd3; font-size: 12px;">(<em>GamePath does not share your info.<br /> [<a href='https://gamepath.io/privacy-policy' target='_blank'>Privacy Policy</a></em>])</p>



4PM
    GP-IQ gp.io updates - 
        - Removed GIF from Success screen to leave more room for chat 
        - Add gif to the end of the chat! 
    https://meanbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/barrel-roll-300x167-1.gif
        - need reminder re making Comments in JSON?

        - moved cform iframe code to "sponsorTagline" to "strains" -- both render html -- good
        - removed sponsor URL. having "" values in sponsor fields should remove "Sponsor" label

    cforms

        this for just text without ask for input
        <input type="text" cf-questions="Perfect, let's get started." name="getstarted">

        <input type="text" required cf-error="Text is wrong wrong|Input is not right" />

        respond to this gh issue: 
        https://github.com/space10-community/conversational-form/issues/325
            - I had analytics.js. this expects gtag.js (throws errors otherwise)
            - With gTM, this works: ...

    - conversational-form - How / does it build for deployment anywhere? or does it need to be installed?
        - build/ is in the root 
        - cp my execution there and see ... 
        - Works as Designed with the specific config file / .html added to build/
            but ... build process adds relative paths to ../../build 
            - so i can't rename the dir 
            - have to put build/ into the renamed dir 
                - THEN review build scripts
            - (aside: review network calls to and from gp.io ... lotsa holdups)
        - Tweak copy; add Fun (emojii and gifs)
            - AFTER getting current build into the live widget on gp.io 
            - have to update, rebuild, re-deploy GP-IQ for gp.io 
    - Video capture of GPs in mobile device 
    - GP-IQ for gp.io updates 
        - single answer (remove multi)
        - answer image sizes
    - gtag.js into gTM - 
        - current c-form execution has both gTM and explicit gtag.js references 

    - VSCode: 
        - Add "Save As ..." to right-click menu 
        - Noise in terminal after awaking from sleep

7:30 

    - have mobile, email being requested 
    - need to capture values / keyboard entry for both 


7:15


start with 

http://localhost:8080/conversational-form/src/development-input-types.html

add gTM 
suck in only phone and email fields 

    - then work in optional, one or the opther 
    - then add events 


7pm
    - conversational-form is working from localhost (http:// not file:///)

http://localhost:8080/conversational-form/src/GP.io-ConvoForm.html

    - Add gTM to this 
    - Doink with it 
    - bubble-chat kicked my ass for some time today. there'd be more to do after. 
    - Get it Working. then make it work better. 


        "A link describing you, your product, or service is optional, ", 
        "And helps respond with a GamePath that works for your business."

    - Complete the Request for Info GamePath for gampath.io 
    - GP-Chatbot - what's being captured in gA? 
        - elements I click are being captured as GP_Answers (GP_Clicks, Outbound) (dirtily, but captured)
        - works accessed from meanbusiness.com or gamepath.io
        - Event Label is null from GP-Chatbot 
            Category - GP_Answers 
            Action - text label, properly / cleanly 
            Label - Null 

            Remove EBLoader from gTM 
                - give steve@meanbusiness.com admin access to smcnally@gmail.com gTM

        - capture class input-wrap
            - grab any text entered 
            - send a gA event 

        - Optimally - 
            - Hide input-wrap until someone clicks mobile or email 
            - sanitize input by stripping it all 
                - strip in chat-bubble does this 
            - feed back what was input 
            - format that feedback 




        - NOT when I'm running from localhost as file:///
            - which i should address. 
            - can i do so by updating /etc/hosts on FtB?
            - else, deploy to test gA / gTM 



200224 - 

If I want to collect cel, email, and link in GP-Vhatbot, 
I need to handle the input, 
make sure it doesn't trigger chat-bubble's miss() 
validate mobile or email 
and ensure gA picks up the customer contact info reasonably. 


Your mobile number or email address
A link describing you, your product, or service. (optional and helpful)

200219 - 

    For thursday, work on FF swiper and chatbots - 

    mozilla
    https://meanbusiness.com/gamepath/qp/mozilla/moz-personal-data/; as elsewhere, remove all sound other than Success. this is another vector of approach theme. 
    https://meanbusiness.com/gamepath/qp/mozilla/ff-switch-IQ/; same execution as above
    https://meanbusiness.com/gamepath/qp/mozilla/ff-container-swiper/; evergreen for switch, for downloading containers. good example of driving downloads. Education and awareness in context.   

    - 7PM - 
    - local chatbots need to be run from /GP_chatbot/chat-bubble/examples/

    file:///home/smcnally/Documents/GP_chatbot/chat-bubble/examples/BlackMedicine-Consumer-chatbot.html

    "It's Cold-Pressed Iced Coffee Intensified for performance."

    add "Intensified for performance with CBD, THC, essence of [strain]"
    with CBD and related ingredients we can't talk about here. 
    Let us know if you'd like to hear about Special Formulations available only near you."

    Need to update this form - file:///home/smcnally/Documents/GP_chatbot/chat-bubble/examples/BlackMedicine-CelNumber.html
        - Works with multiple CRMs 
        - here's with Pinpoint and SES (or what it was)

--

    - GP executions are now in their own repo? 
    - else update .gitignore in GP-IQ 
    - right now, not tracking new *quizQuestions.js and *personalityResults.js in GP-IQ . fine if the executions repo is good to go 
    - 5:22 - will leave new configs in the fs for now. I should have an executions-only repo -- though they're tied to other changes made ... whichneeds to be addressed . maybe links to a deeper page - product-specific page (no need. move to Download / FF)
    - fttb, i'm in the appropriate branch WhichIsYourBrand - 
    - 6:26 - WhichIsYourBrand / findYourBrand-* is in good shape. 
    - "Drive traffic to your property" is solved with this. 
    - Next ups: 1) foot traffic to retail locations, 2) download software. 
        - Calculator, Coffee chatbot, and FF swiper are the examples. 
        - Calculator is "put this in your cart" 
        - Coffee chatbot is "answer a bunch of questions and get a coupn code" 
        - FF is DOwnload software. (put more link / CTA into lower3rds)
