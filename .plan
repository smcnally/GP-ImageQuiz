smc-mozilla branch - Deleting 
            - RT's got updates in .js files all of which can likely be accepted 
            https://github.com/smcnally/GP-IQ/compare/master...smc-mozilla?expand=1
            src/App.js

                - Just adds the optional answer image / imgSrc.
                - which is definitely in master  

            src/components/Question.js

                - RT's much better handling 
                - SMc - Thinking these both are accounted for 
                    - Yes - this is in master 
                    /home/smcnally/Documents/GP-IQ/src/components/Question.js

            src/index.css

                - these are in master, too 
                - much of this style rules are commented out leading with 
                /* moved to header_intro.css
                /home/smcnally/Documents/GP-IQ/src/index.css:29
                - PLUS all style rules need review / reconsideration
                - So, we should just delete smc-mozilla  


tylt branch is a config and margin change. Deleting
gpupdates1 is Constellation-related. Won't delete tonight 
ff-switch -  Won't delete tonight
    minor changes to 
        src/App.js
        src/components/Result.js

8PM 
    To Do - picking up later 
        - Move the IQ configs out of Swipe tree on FtB - DONE 
        - Go through more IQ configs, but they're all Working (not blowing up app)
        - Review [Dev] and [CSS] tasks, but 
        - [GameDev] tasks are higher-prio than refactors and enhancements, like these e.g.   
           - [GameDev] - make EmilyNussBot work and share with Emily.
                        - Complete the execution 
                        - Share with Mike D and David C. 
                        - Bullet the plan for how I'll get it out 
                        - Ask them what they need to also distribute?  
           - [GameDev] - create results for celebQuotes and NJCI to drive TextProject subs  
                    - "[] Goes deep into cannabis for NJ.com"
                    - "Find [] on [{twtr}, {site}, {channel}]"
                    - "Get up close with [] on TextProject"]
                        - SMc - find the words they use 
                        - Complete the execution 
                        - Share with Mike D and David C. 
                        - Bullet the plan for how I'll get it out 
                        - Ask them what they need to also distribute?

Dev and CSS tasks (Speach to Text had that as "Death in CSS tasks")
[Dev] and [CSS] tasks

        All for after [gamedev] tasks
            [Dev] explore config‘s that work in other branches
            [Dev] explore Rogers code not yet reflected in master
            [Dev] CSS - check out styles used, image constraints, etc. 

    - Config Tests (LIFO)

    celebQuotes-quizQuestions.js
        - Works 
        - Where the celebQuote personality results? 
            - look for personalityResults with "Quotifying"
            - Don't see any. prolly not done. 
            - quizResult: Quotifying is in Result node
            - [GameDev] - so results are needed 
            - this is a good newsworthy thing i will ask Mike D about for News and Tyle GamePaths 
                - GameDev to drive TextProject subs and Tylt followers 
                    - "[] Goes deep into cannabis for NJ.com"
                    - "Find [] on [{twtr}, {site}, {channel}]"
                    - "Get up close with [] on TextProject"]
                        - SMc - find the words they use 
                        - Complete the execution 
                        - Share with Mike D and David C. 
                        - Bullet the plan for how I'll get it out 
                        - Ask them what they need to also distribute? 



        - [Dev] - Move from here is to get the IQ configs out of the Swipe dir. 
            - Move them to ~/Documents/GP-Swiper/src/api to ./GP-IQ_Configs_FtB
            - LATER - compare overlap and gaps per MBP17 IQ configs. 
        - has 7 questions; does App node know? 
            - doesn't look like this DOES 
            - looks like it COULD 
            - the Quiz node knows -- questionTotal

    CoralProject-Guides-quizQuestions.js
        - Works 
        - Not as refined as CoralProject-Personas-quizQuestions.js
        - Clearly an earlier state of production 
        - Result node has helpful info 
        - App node has plenty of DIFFERNT and less-helpful info that Result node (compare same against CoralProject-Personas-quizQuestions App and Result nodes)
        - Uses Multi  -- Next button takes space 
        - [CSS] - wants to be more horizontal
            - when not using multi, that Next space is still reserved
            -  fix that in post-production!

    Accessibility-quizQuestions.js
        - Works fine

            - No title

        [ASIDES - "Get Started" / Intro slide is good to have]

        - ran thru FF' accessibility checks -

    - GP-IQ - 
        - I've eyeballed a few branches compared with master 
        - There are a couple of branches from Roger that should be merged 
            - It will have to be manually done. 
            - Conflicts in config files are fine - think through how to save them both 
            - RT's got updates in .js files all of which can likely be accepted 
            https://github.com/smcnally/GP-IQ/compare/master...smc-mozilla?expand=1
            src/App.js
            src/components/Question.js
            src/index.css
        
        - I've got tweaks in a branches that look straightforward to rectify
        https://github.com/smcnally/GP-IQ/compare/master...ff-switch?expand=1
        Layout options; including / excluding property values in the app and result screens
            src/App.js
            src/components/Result.js
        
        https://github.com/smcnally/GP-IQ/compare/master...ASKandOFFER?expand=1
        .gitignore and .plan 

        https://github.com/smcnally/GP-IQ/compare/master...tylt?expand=1
        src/index.css and a config file 

        https://github.com/smcnally/GP-IQ/compare/master...gpupdates1?expand=1
        changes to app code and quizQuestions / personalityResults configs 

        - Many of the conflicts for all branches are config / execution files 
            - have to eyeball to see which we keep, which changes we accept, and which successfully run on which branch

        - though i should re-build and redeploy to ensure All is Well in the local code 
    - Now back to video capture, etc.

the whole time doinking with all the other css, it was leading font family with Roboto that funcked things up

    OK - With big dumb explicit css paths set, I'm overriding styles in-line in the .html config itself. Taking the "Win" for now and moving on

            cf-context needs to be < 295

    - OK - Now it's updated on gp.io
https://gamepath.io/gamepath/GamePath.io-FocusAreas

    - get c-f .css reflecting what I have locally 

    https://gamepath.io/gamepath/GP.io-cforms/build/

    have to change the css in src/ v /build 
    and then re-build
    and then re-deploy 
    (first: I'll change the .css in the current build on the server - NO I WONT)

        - override .css locally / in-line

7PM 

    - In the GP-IQ success screen, the conversational-form leads with a ton of space above the start of the content well. 
    - the GP-IQ build iframes this on the Success screen: https://gamepath.io/gamepath/GP.io-cforms/build/ -- update the c-f file and update the index.html symlink to point to the new version 


6:30

        respond to this gh issue: 
        https://github.com/space10-community/conversational-form/issues/325
            - I had analytics.js. this expects gtag.js (throws errors otherwise)
            - With gTM, this works: ...

    - conversational-form - How / does it build for deployment anywhere? or does it need to be installed?
        - build/ is in the root 
        - cp my execution there and see ... 
        - Works as Designed with the specific config file / .html added to build/
            but ... build process adds relative paths to ../../build 
            - so i can't rename the dir 
            - have to put build/ into the renamed dir 
                - THEN review build scripts
            - (aside: review network calls to and from gp.io ... lotsa holdups)
        - Tweak copy; add Fun (emojii and gifs)
            - AFTER getting current build into the live widget on gp.io 
            - have to update, rebuild, re-deploy GP-IQ for gp.io 
    - Video capture of GPs in mobile device 
    - GP-IQ for gp.io updates 
        - single answer (remove multi)
        - answer image sizes
    - gtag.js into gTM - 
        - current c-form execution has both gTM and explicit gtag.js references 

    - VSCode: 
        - Add "Save As ..." to right-click menu 
        - Noise in terminal after awaking from sleep

7:30 

    - have mobile, email being requested 
    - need to capture values / keyboard entry for both 


7:15


start with 

http://localhost:8080/conversational-form/src/development-input-types.html

add gTM 
suck in only phone and email fields 

    - then work in optional, one or the opther 
    - then add events 


7pm
    - conversational-form is working from localhost (http:// not file:///)

http://localhost:8080/conversational-form/src/GP.io-ConvoForm.html

    - Add gTM to this 
    - Doink with it 
    - bubble-chat kicked my ass for some time today. there'd be more to do after. 
    - Get it Working. then make it work better. 


        "A link describing you, your product, or service is optional, ", 
        "And helps respond with a GamePath that works for your business."

    - Complete the Request for Info GamePath for gampath.io 
    - GP-Chatbot - what's being captured in gA? 
        - elements I click are being captured as GP_Answers (GP_Clicks, Outbound) (dirtily, but captured)
        - works accessed from meanbusiness.com or gamepath.io
        - Event Label is null from GP-Chatbot 
            Category - GP_Answers 
            Action - text label, properly / cleanly 
            Label - Null 

            Remove EBLoader from gTM 
                - give steve@meanbusiness.com admin access to smcnally@gmail.com gTM

        - capture class input-wrap
            - grab any text entered 
            - send a gA event 

        - Optimally - 
            - Hide input-wrap until someone clicks mobile or email 
            - sanitize input by stripping it all 
                - strip in chat-bubble does this 
            - feed back what was input 
            - format that feedback 




        - NOT when I'm running from localhost as file:///
            - which i should address. 
            - can i do so by updating /etc/hosts on FtB?
            - else, deploy to test gA / gTM 



200224 - 

If I want to collect cel, email, and link in GP-Vhatbot, 
I need to handle the input, 
make sure it doesn't trigger chat-bubble's miss() 
validate mobile or email 
and ensure gA picks up the customer contact info reasonably. 


Your mobile number or email address
A link describing you, your product, or service. (optional and helpful)

            - Drives Clickthroughs and Opt-Ins to SMS lists 
            - Execution is clean
                - Update copy to include Cannabis-Infused special offer "available only at these local shops" before "Do Exceptionally-Smart People ..."
                - Update copy after [Privacy Policy] to note ~ "Coupon is good for 2 hours. "If you're not ready to shop now, let us know and we'll send you future offers. ... But 'Black Medicine - Intensified' is a limited-run exclusive."

            - Drive Downloads
            - Execution is clean
                - Images are in-place and good (sizing good) 
                - Emoji need display format work -they're B&W

        where are the execution config files? (see them on WD3TB / 27iMac)
            Now on FtB local: 
            /Documents/GP-IQ/src/api
            Reliever_Relaxer-*

        Good one as it's clean 
        Can keep the sound in the last 
        (or simpler click sounds for quicker load times & some feedback[tbd])
        Success Screen needs updates 
            for Drive to Store / Drive to Delivery 
            with specific product recs and promotions

To Be Done: 

    Get image sizes correct. 
    wp-cli doesn't resize animated gifs as animated gifs
    lower3rds styles - typeface, anchor links underlined and link-blue 

    - Get all execution configs into a single repo 
        - Note on each the mechanic, build, and branch they belong to

            "Add to Cart" from Weedmaps is not a straightforward URL 
                - already a hairy yak and distraction from a completed GP-Swiper

    - GP-IQ, GP-chatbot - have good examples 
    - Drive to Store, Drive to Shopping Cart, Drive Downloads - have good examples 
    - Blackmedicine chatbot also has drive to opt-ins to sms

        - best to in Cannabis 
        - Drive outbound clicks

    GP-Swiper

        - All the images work

    GP chatbot

        - Has CTAs to download FF and Fb Container in-dialog - +1
        - [Start Over] at the end is handy for dev; not for final

    For thursday, work on FF swiper and chatbots - 

    mozilla
    https://meanbusiness.com/gamepath/qp/mozilla/moz-personal-data/; as elsewhere, remove all sound other than Success. this is another vector of approach theme. 
    https://meanbusiness.com/gamepath/qp/mozilla/ff-switch-IQ/; same execution as above
    https://meanbusiness.com/gamepath/qp/mozilla/ff-container-swiper/; evergreen for switch, for downloading containers. good example of driving downloads. Education and awareness in context.   

    - 7PM - 
    - local chatbots need to be run from /GP_chatbot/chat-bubble/examples/

    "It's Cold-Pressed Iced Coffee Intensified for performance."

    add "Intensified for performance with CBD, THC, essence of [strain]"
    with CBD and related ingredients we can't talk about here. 
    Let us know if you'd like to hear about Special Formulations available only near you."

    Need to update this form - file:///home/smcnally/Documents/GP_chatbot/chat-bubble/examples/BlackMedicine-CelNumber.html
        - Works with multiple CRMs 
        - here's with Pinpoint and SES (or what it was)

--

    - GP executions are now in their own repo? 
    - else update .gitignore in GP-IQ 
    - right now, not tracking new *quizQuestions.js and *personalityResults.js in GP-IQ . fine if the executions repo is good to go 
    - 5:22 - will leave new configs in the fs for now. I should have an executions-only repo -- though they're tied to other changes made ... whichneeds to be addressed . maybe links to a deeper page - product-specific page (no need. move to Download / FF)
    - fttb, i'm in the appropriate branch WhichIsYourBrand - 
    - 6:26 - WhichIsYourBrand / findYourBrand-* is in good shape. 
    - "Drive traffic to your property" is solved with this. 
    - Next ups: 1) foot traffic to retail locations, 2) download software. 
        - Calculator, Coffee chatbot, and FF swiper are the examples. 
        - Calculator is "put this in your cart" 
        - Coffee chatbot is "answer a bunch of questions and get a coupn code" 
        - FF is DOwnload software. (put more link / CTA into lower3rds)
